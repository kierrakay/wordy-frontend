Welcome Nerd!

If you're a word enthusiast like we are, then you've come to the right place. The letters are placed on the board slowly at first, but don't get too comfortable! As time goes on, the rate of new tiles will get faster and faster. Every minute you get a word bomb to clear the board - hit space to use it. Once the board fills up it's GAME OVER. Happy nerding!
